   - You should get back the few notes you sent earlier

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Install Docker following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
You may have to uninstall Docker if you installed it using a different guide.

Clone repository and enter directory:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Cameri/nostream.git
  cd nostream
  ```

Generate a secret with: `openssl rand -hex 128`
Copy the output and paste it into an `.env` file:

  ```
  SECRET=aaabbbccc...dddeeefff
  # Secret shortened for brevity
  ```

Start:
  ```
  ./scripts/start
  ```
  or
  ```
  ./scripts/start_with_tor
  ```

Stop the server with:
  ```
  ./scripts/stop
  ```

Print the Tor hostname:
  ```
  ./scripts/print_tor_hostname
  ```

### Running as a Service

By default this server will run continuously until you stop it with Ctrl+C or until the system restarts.

You can [install as a systemd service](https://www.swissrouting.com/nostr.html#installing-as-a-service) if you want the server to run again automatically whenever the system is restarted. For example:

  ```
  $ nano /etc/systemd/system/nostream.service

  # Note: replace "User=..." with your username, and
  # "/home/nostr/nostream" with the directory where you cloned the repo.

  [Unit]
  Description=Nostr TS Relay
  After=network.target
  StartLimitIntervalSec=0

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=5
  User=nostr
  WorkingDirectory=/home/nostr/nostream
  ExecStart=/home/nostr/nostream/scripts/start
  ExecStop=/home/nostr/nostream/scripts/stop

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

And then:

  ```
  systemctl enable nostream
  systemctl start nostream
  ```

The logs can be viewed with:

  ```
  journalctl -u nostream
  ```

## Quick Start (Standalone)

Set the following environment variables:

  ```
  DB_URI="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nostr_ts_relay_test"
  DB_USER=postgres
  ```
  or
  ```
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_NAME=nostr_ts_relay
  DB_USER=postgres
  DB_PASSWORD=postgres
  ```

  ```
  REDIS_URI="redis://default:nostr_ts_relay@localhost:6379"

  REDIS_HOST=localhost
  REDIS_PORT=6379
  REDIS_USER=default
  REDIS_PASSWORD=nostr_ts_relay
  ```

Generate a long random secret and set SECRET:
You may want to use `openssl rand -hex 128` to generate a secret.

  ```
  SECRET=aaabbbccc...dddeeefff
  # Secret shortened for brevity
  ```

### Initializing the database

Create `nostr_ts_relay` database:

  ```
  $ psql -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -W
  postgres=# create database nostr_ts_relay;
  postgres=# quit
  ```

Start Redis and use `redis-cli` to set the default password and verify:
  ```
  $ redis-cli
  127.0.0.1:6379> CONFIG SET requirepass "nostr_ts_relay"
  OK
  127.0.0.1:6379> AUTH nostr_ts_relay
  Ok
  ```

Clone repository and enter directory:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Cameri/nostream.git
  cd nostream
  ```

Install dependencies:

  ```
  npm install -g knex
  npm install
  ```

Run migrations (at least once and after pulling new changes):

  ```
  NODE_OPTIONS="-r dotenv/config" npm run db:migrate
  ```

Create .nostr folder inside nostream project folder and copy over the settings file:

  ```
  mkdir .nostr
  cp resources/default-settings.yaml .nostr/settings.yaml
  ```

To start in development mode:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

Or, start in production mode:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

To clean up the build, coverage and test reports run:

  ```
  npm run clean
  ```
## Development Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Install Docker Desktop following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
You may have to uninstall Docker on your machine if you installed it using a different guide.

Clone repository and enter directory:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Cameri/nostream.git
  cd nostream
  ```

Start:
  ```
  ./scripts/start_local
  ```

  This will run in the foreground of the terminal until you stop it with Ctrl+C.

## Tests

### Unit tests

Open a terminal and change to the project's directory:
  ```
  cd /path/to/nostream
  ```

Run unit tests with:

  ```
  npm run test:unit
  ```

Or, run unit tests in watch mode:

  ```
  npm run test:unit:watch
  ```

To get unit test coverage run:

  ```
  npm run cover:unit
  ```

To see the unit tests report open `.test-reports/unit/index.html` with a browser:
  ```
  open .test-reports/unit/index.html
  ```

To see the unit tests coverage report open `.coverage/unit/lcov-report/index.html` with a browser:
  ```
  open .coverage/unit/lcov-report/index.html
  ```

### Integration tests (Docker Compose)

Open a terminal and change to the project's directory:
  ```
  cd /path/to/nostream
  ```

Run integration tests with:

  ```
  npm run docker:test:integration
  ```

And to get integration test coverage run:

  ```
  npm run docker:cover:integration
  ```

### Integration tests (Standalone)

Open a terminal and change to the project's directory:
  ```
  cd /path/to/nostream
  ```

Set the following environment variables:

  ```
  DB_URI="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nostr_ts_relay_test"

  or

  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_NAME=nostr_ts_relay_test
  DB_USER=postgres
  DB_PASSWORD=postgres
  DB_MIN_POOL_SIZE=1
  DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE=2
  ```

Then run the integration tests:

  ```
  npm run test:integration
  ```

To see the integration tests report open `.test-reports/integration/report.html` with a browser:
  ```
  open .test-reports/integration/report.html
  ```

To get the integration test coverage run:

  ```
  npm run cover:integration
  ```

To see the integration test coverage report open `.coverage/integration/lcov-report/index.html` with a browser.

  ```
  open .coverage/integration/lcov-report/index.html
  ```

## Configuration

You can change the default folder by setting the `NOSTR_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to a different path.

Run nostream using one of the quick-start guides at least once and `nostream/.nostr/settings.json` will be created.
Any changes made to the settings file will be read on the next start.

Default settings can be found under `resources/default-settings.yaml`. Feel free to copy it to `nostream/.nostr/settings.yaml` if you would like to have a settings file before running the relay first.

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for a detailed explanation of each environment variable and setting.
